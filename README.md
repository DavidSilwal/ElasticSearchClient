# ElasticSearchClient

A work in progress playground for a low alloc, high performance, low-level ElasticSearch client. Not intended for production!!

Experimenting and learning to use features such as Span<T>, Memory<T>, Utf8JsonReader along with benchmarking techniques.

Designed around a very specific use case and not intended as a general purpose client for production use!

*Note: Requires .NET Core 3.0 preview 2 or higher to compile and run this code.*
